# Tiling the Sky for the Hector Galaxy Survey

This documentation describes the code I've written to go from a catalogue of galaxies to individual tiles which are ready to go through the [Hector Observing Pipeline](https://samvaughan.info/hector-observing/).

This code is a `python` translation of Aaron Robotham's `R` code written for the GAMA survey (described in the paper [Optimal Tiling of Dense Surveys with a Multi-Object Spectrograph](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010PASA...27...76R/abstract)). Be sure to cite Aaron's work when referencing this code!
